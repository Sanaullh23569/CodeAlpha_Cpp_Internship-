# 🏦 Banking System – C++ Project (CodeAlpha Internship)

This project is part of my submission for the **CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship**.

It demonstrates a basic **Banking System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in C++. The program simulates account creation, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, and transaction tracking.

---

## 🎯 Features

- Create customer bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw money
- Transfer funds between accounts
- View account balance
- View recent transaction history
- Fully implemented using OOP: classes, encapsulation, and methods

---

## 💼 How the Banking System Works

The system includes the following classes:

- **Customer**: Stores customer details
- **Account**: Manages balance, account number, and owner
- **Transaction**: Records transaction logs (deposits, withdrawals, transfers)

The user interacts via a **simple console menu** to perform actions like:

Create Account

Deposit

Withdraw

Transfer Funds

View Balance

View Transactions

Exit



All actions are stored in memory and handled using class functions.

---

## 🧠 How It Works Internally

- `Account` class stores balance, and handles deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- Each transaction is stored in a history list or printed immediately.
- Console-based interface allows interaction with multiple account objects.
- You can extend this further by adding file handling or authentication (optional).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Concepts: Classes, Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, File I/O (optional)
- Tools: Any standard compiler (e.g., g++, VS Code, Code::Blocks)
