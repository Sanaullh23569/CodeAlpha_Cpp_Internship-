# 🔐 Login & Registration System – C++ Project (CodeAlpha Internship)

This project is part of my submission for the **CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship**.

It demonstrates a simple **Login and Registration System** built using C++. The system allows users to register with a
username and password,stores credentials securely in a file, and allows users to log in with proper validation.

---

## 🎯 Features

- User **Registration** with unique username
- Secure **Login** validation using stored data
- Stores user credentials in a **text file**
- File-based user database (plain text format)
- Input validation with success and error messages

---

## 🔑 How the System Works

The system offers a basic menu with options:

Register

Login

Exit


- During **registration**, the system checks for duplicate usernames before saving.
- During **login**, it reads the file and matches the entered credentials.
- All user data is stored in a local `.txt` file for simplicity.

## 🔐 Security Note

> 🔒 This project is for learning purposes only and **does not hash passwords**. In real applications, always hash passwords using secure
> algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, SHA-256).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Concepts: File I/O, Conditionals, Loops, Strings
- Tools: Any standard compiler (e.g., g++, VS Code, Code::Blocks)

## 📂 Files

- `login_system.cpp` — Main C++ source code
- `users.txt` — Stores registered usernames and passwords
- `README.md` — Project documentation
